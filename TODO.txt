## Public Host
    Unable to supply host while running the server

## Fix the migration
    Set up a proper migration method
    maybe migrate-down is needed too
    maybe it is simpler to upload image on docker hub and then pull it from there (saves pain of building image everytime)
    use a tool for db migration

## Tests
    Write tests for handlers
    - Get Terminal Pending

## User Management
    container history management
    better security for the containers of users
    implement mount point feature


// install some beautiful terminal in jupyter notebook image
// auto complete, colorgul highlghts and history (up arrow key) works from terminal itself
